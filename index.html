            <p>Welcome to my WEB215 page! Feel free to explore and see what I'm creating as I pursue my studies to become a Web Developer.</p>  
            <p>Why Blue Orchid? That's a great question! The inspiration came when our professor asked us to think 
                of a quality that starts with the first letter of our first name, along with a living thing 
                that starts with the first letter of our last name.</p>  
            <p>"Brave Owl" was for WEB115, but I’m realizing I need more ideas beyond just B and O!</p>
            <p>If you are not done with my talking, you can learn more reading my <a href="#introduction">Introduction</a>!</p>
